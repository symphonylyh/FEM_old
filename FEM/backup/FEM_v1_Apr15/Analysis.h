/* Abstract base Analysis class with shared public methods and pure virtual methods.
 *
 * Key concepts of during the design of this class:
 *
 * 1. One of the benefits of C++ inheritance feature is the code can be kept
 * in the most concise way. For example, we defined a Analysis base class here,
 * and we will have derived class such as linear elastic class, nonlinear elastic,
 * viscoelastic, etc. Furthermore, we can also have classes derived from the
 * already derived class, like linear isotropic and linear anisotropic class from
 * the linear elastic class. The subroutines/functions/procedures that are
 * shared by the derived classes can be abstracted and defined in the base class,
 * while derived classes can still define other subroutines/functions/procedures
 * as their own features. In this way, our program is elegantly organized and
 * extendable, with the minimum redundancy in codes.
 *
 * 2. The information such as mesh, global stiffness, force, etc should be used
 * in any type of the problems, so they have been made public (specifically,
 * protected) in Analysis class. By inheritance we have all those info as public
 * in the derived classes. It is noted that we should avoid name confliction
 * when we define the own variables of the derived classes.
 * In addition, from a memory allocation view, the base class's memory space is
 * allocated inside the memory space of this derived class. But these space are
 * just copies from the base class, i.e., if we have a second derived class,
 * these space are independent and uniquely of their own.
