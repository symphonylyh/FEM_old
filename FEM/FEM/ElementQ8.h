        /* Private helper structure for the bullet-proof memory management of
         * the static members of this class.
         *
         * This is the elegant solution to pave our path for a powerful
         * hybrid element system. There are several improvements made throughout
         * the development of this module:
         *
         * 1. "Shape" is a general property of a given element type, which does
         * not depend on the instances of that class. In other words, if we
         * add Shape as a class member, we will have 100 Shape objects in memory when
         * we create 100 elements, which is very unwise. Thus, we use a static
         * member that is a intrinsic property of the whole class and can be
         * shared by all its instances (with memory just allocated once).
         *
         * 2. At first we define a static Shape object in the class as:
         *
         * in .h:   static ShapeQ8 shape;
         * in .cpp: ShapeQ8 ElementQ8::shape;
         *
         * However, when we want to use the shape in our hybrid system (for
         * apply load, strain and stress computation, etc), it is inconvenient
         * that we need to figure out which type the element is and the choose
         * the corresponding shape. This requires a if/else judge and becomes
         * redundant when element types increase. Thus, a polymorphed Shape
         * pointer is used to provide the flexibility.
         *
         * 3. So far so good. But, in order to use a pointer we need to allocate
         * it on heap by Shape* shape = new ShapeQ8, then where can we delete it
         * to prevent memory leak? One option is to delete this static pointer
         * before we exit the main(), but this means this class is not
         * self-consistent and requires the client to be careful enough to delete
         * it at the end, which no one can promise. Thus, we use an internal
         * structure to manage all the static members we have in the class, and
         * the constructor & destructor of this structure takes over the
         * create & destroy task for us. Before the program starts, the static
         * structure is initialized by its constructor; when the program exists,
         * the structure is destroyed and its destructor is called so that the
         * shape object on heap is deallocated. This is a perfect solution for
         * memory management.
