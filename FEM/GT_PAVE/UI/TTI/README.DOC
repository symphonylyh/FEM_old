Test results on sand are saved in ASCII files with the filename SAx.ASC where
x is the confining pressure in psi.  Laboratory triaxial tests under monotonic
loading were conducted at confining pressures of 2, 5 and 10 psi.  Test data
on crushed limestone are in the LSx.ASC files.

The data for each record consist of:

1)  time (seconds);
2)  applied load (kips);
3)  ram displacement (inches);
4)  three radial displacements (inches);  and
5)  three vertical displacements (inches).

The specimens tested were 6 inches in diameter.  Vertical displacements were
measured over a 5-inch gauge length.
